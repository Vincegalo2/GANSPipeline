# 🚀 GANSPipeline: A Data Engineering Project

GANSPipeline is a cutting-edge data engineering project, completed as part of my coursework at WBS Coding School. It is designed to extract, process, and store real-time flight and weather data in a cloud-based MySQL database. Utilizing a suite of advanced technologies including Python, SQL, and AWS, GANSPipeline automates data flow to ensure real-time data availability and seamless integration for comprehensive analysis.
